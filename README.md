# Portfolio Website 
**Assignment Notes**

Live URL: [https://rubinod1.github.io/portfolio/](https://rubinod1.github.io/portfolio/)

Git repository: [https://github.com/RubinoD1/portfolio](https://github.com/RubinoD1/portfolio)

 I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- Added my name as part of the site's header.
- A recent photo: added a photo of myself in the about me section of the site.
- Links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them: added a about me, portfolio, and contact section to the nav bar with working links to each section of the site. 

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- Made the first application into a unique class and set it to take up a line of its own display wise. The other listed applications have a smaller layout in comparison. 

WHEN I click on the images of the applications then I am taken to that deployed application
- The image for the main portfolio application goes to the GitHub Pages live URL of the run-buddy site.
- There were no other applications that I could add at the moment so the other links are just placeholders at the moment. A unique image that I took was used as an "under-construction" placeholder, until I replace them at a later date. 

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
- 980px resolution, increased the text size for easier reading. The ".portfolio ul li" items were adjusted to better align with each other.  
- 768px resolution, made only minor changes to the portfolio elements and the image size of the main portfolio to better fit this resolution. 
- 575px resolution, made the previous layout in the portfolio section into a single row and adjusted the text position. Adjusted the width of the ".portfolio-main-img" to fit smaller screen sizes, the image was being cut off on both sides on smaller devices. 

Sample of potential employee's previous work 
- Added the run-buddy module site as a project as I have nothing else at the moment to put within the projects section. This will be removed once I have more work that can replace this.
